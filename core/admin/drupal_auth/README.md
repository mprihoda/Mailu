# Checkpass for drupal

This module started as checkpass module for Dovecot. It turned out that the Mailu authentication is performed by nginx proxy,
which changed the need and direct integration has been performed. The main method is not used for now, but still, it would
be working checkpass authentication against Drupal, if ever needed.
